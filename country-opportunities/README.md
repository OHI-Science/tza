## README Tanzania [tza]

This folder contains information for Tanzania from the OHI global assessments. [View the report-template file](https://rawgit.com/OHI-Science/tza/master/country-opportunities/report-template.html) that will let you explore data directly from the `ohi-global` repository, or modify the `.Rmd` file. In OHI global assessments, Tanzania has a region identifier (rgn_id) of 202.

In a few cases, data files are saved locally as `.csv` files for Tanzania only because data for all regions are too big and are not kept on GitHub.
